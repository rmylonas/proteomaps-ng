  <h2>Some documentation</h2>
  MixMHCp is a website to identify clusters within large datasets of short peptides.<br>
  The different clusters are mathematically modelled with Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) that can be visualized with sequence logos and are often referred to as "motifs".
  <br><br>
  The algorithm automatically learns the entries of these PWMs and their respective weight.<br>The learning is based on mixture models and maximum likelihood (EM algorithm).
  <br>

  <h3>Input</h3>
        As input, you should give a list of peptides, all of the same length and consisting only of natural amino acids. 
        <br>The list of peptides can be in standard text format with each peptide on a different line, or in fasta format.<br>Be careful not to load files with metadata, such as Excel spreadsheets.
        <br>"Max nr of motifs" corresponds to the maximal number of motifs that should be explored (Maximal value is 20).
        
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <h4>Graphical output</h4>
        The different logos representing each cluster are shown for different numbers of clusters (up to "Max nr of motifs"), as well as the number of peptides assigned to them.
        
        <h4>Downloadable output</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The <code>responsibility/</code> folder contains the assignment of each peptide to each cluster for the different number of clusters.<br>These values correspond to the contribution of each peptide to each cluster or motif.<br>Peptide assignment to each cluster can be done by considering the max of the responsibility values.</li>
        <li>The <code>Multiple_PWMs/</code> folder contains the PWMs that optimally model the input data.<br>Of note, these are not meant to be used as predictors, since they do not include any renormalization for background frequencies<br>and the prior used in the mixture model may not be optimal for training predictors.</li>
        <li>The <code>logos/</code> folder contains the logos (.png) representing each cluster.<br>Logos have been generate with the <a href="http://baderlab.org/Software/LOLA">LoLa</a> software.<br>The logos.html file allows you to quickly visualize all the logos.</li>
        <li>The <code>data/</code> folder contains the input data. </li>
        <li>The <code>KLD/</code> folder contains the KLD scores for each number of motifs, as well as the predicted optimal number of motifs.<br>However, it is in general advisable to manually go through the motifs to check the optimal number of motifs, since this number may depend on the input data and the kind of application that you want. </li>
      </ul>
      
        <h2>Other information</h2>
        MixMHCp algorithm is developed by the <a href="http://www.unil.ch/dof/research/gfeller">Computational Cancer Biology Lab</a> at the Ludwig Center for Cancer Research at <a href="http://unil.ch/index.html">UNIL</a> headed by Prof. David Gfeller, in collaboration with the Vital-IT team.    
      <br>
      <br>
        In the past, the method has been successfully applied to phage display data to identify multiple specificity patterns [Gfeller et al, MSB 2011; Kim et al. NAR 2012] and HLA peptidomics data to deconvolute mixtures of HLA ligands coming from up to 6 alleles [Bassani-Sternberg and Gfeller, JI 2016; Bassani-Sternberg et al. bioRxiv 2017].
