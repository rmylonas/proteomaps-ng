  <h2>Documentation</h2>
    MixMHCp is a webserver to identify motifs within large datasets of peptides.<br>
    The different motifs are mathematically modelled with Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) that are visualized with sequence logos. MixMHCp2.0 includes several features optimized for HLA-I ligands, but it can also be run on peptides from other origins.
  <br><br>
    The algorithm automatically learns the entries of the PWMs and their respective weight.
    The learning is based on mixture models and maximum likelihood (EM algorithm).
    <br>

    The command-line script for Mac or Linux can be obtained at:

    <br>

    <h3>Input</h3>
    As input, you should give a list of pre-aligned peptides consisting only of natural amino acids (no gaps).
    <br>
    The list of peptides can be in standard text format with each peptide on a different line, or in fasta format.
    <br>
    Be careful not to load files with metadata, such as Excel spreadsheets.
    <br>
    Peptides can be of different lengths, but the algorithm assumes that for most peptides the most specific positions are found at the beginning (first three positions) and the end (last two positions), as it is the case for HLA-I ligands, and treats additional residues at middle position for peptides longer than the core as insertions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Max nr of motifs</strong> corresponds to the maximal number of motifs that should be explored. Default value is 6 (as in many HLA peptidomics datasets, although exploring larger number of motifs can often be useful to identify motifs supported by less peptides), maximal value is 50.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Core length</strong> corresponds to the length of the core. The motif deconvolution is first performed on peptides with length equal to core length. The motifs inferred by the algorithm are then used to score peptides of other lengths based on the first three and last two positions. This assumes that longer peptides on average have insertions between the first three and last two positions, as it is the case for HLA-I ligands, although the algorithm can also detect cases of N- or C-terminal extensions (see below and Gfeller et al. BioRxiv 2018). Default value is 9.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Trash</strong> integrates a flat motif in the motif deconvolution. Peptides that do not match any other motifs inferred from the data are assigned to this motif. This is useful to remove potential noise in the data. Default value is Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    The example provided in input for testing comes from HLA-I peptidomics profiling of SupB15WT cell line from [Bassani-Sternberg et al. MCP 2015]. The optimal number of motif for this example is equal to 8 (HLA-A03:01 - motifs 6 and 8, HLA-A11:01 - motifs 1 and 7, HLA-B51:01 - motif 2, HLA-B52:01 - motif 4, HLA-C12:04 - motif 3, HLA-C14:02 - motif 5).
    <br>
    <br>
    If you run MixMHCp2.0 on other pre-aligned peptides than HLA-I ligands, we advise to treat each peptide length independently, setting the core length equal to the peptide length. MixMHCp cannot align the peptides, but we are working on a more general algorithm to identify motifs in non-aligned peptide lists.
    <br>
        
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <h4>Graphical output</h4>
    For each peptide length, the different logos representing each motif are shown for different total numbers of motifs (from one motif to "Max nr of motifs"), as well as the number of peptides assigned to them. Peptide length distributions are also displayed for each motif.
        
        <h4>Downloadable output</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The <code>responsibility/</code> folder contains the responsibility of each peptide to each motif for the different number of motifs (resp_n.txt for n motifs).
      These values correspond to the contribution of each peptide to each motif.
      Peptide assignment to each motif can be done by considering the max of the responsibility values.
      <br>
      In addition, for each motif, the optimal position of the beginning and the end of the motif used to score the peptides is shown. This is useful to detect cases of N- or C-terminal extensions. For peptides of length equal to core length, these values are always equal to 1 and "Core length", respectively.
  </li>
      <li>The <code>weights/</code> folder contains information about the weight of each motif for each total number of motifs (<code>weights_n.txt</code>). In addition the peptide length distribution for each motif is shown in <code>weights/plots/</code>. Finally the <code>length_distribution.html</code> shows all peptide length distributions for each motif and for each total number of motifs.
      </li>
      <li>
          The <code>Multiple_PWMs/</code> folder contains the PWMs that optimally model the input data (only of length equal to core length). Of note, these are not meant to be used as predictors, since they do not include any renormalization for background frequencies and the prior used in the mixture model may not be optimal for training predictors.
      </li>
      <li>
          The <code>logos/</code> folder contains the logos (.png) representing each motif for each total number of motifs. Logos have been generate with the <a href="http://baderlab.org/Software/LOLA">LoLa</a> software. The <code>logos.html</code> file allows you to quickly visualize all the logos of length equal to core length. Logos for other peptide lengths can be seen in <code>logos_html/</code> folder.
      </li>
        <li>The <code>data/</code> folder contains the input data. </li>
        <li>
            The <code>KLD/</code> folder contains the KLD scores for each number of motifs [Andreatta et al. Bioinformatics 2013], as well as the predicted optimal number of motifs [see Bassani-Sternberg and Gfeller, J Immunol. 2016]. However, it is in general advised to manually go through the motifs to check the optimal number of motifs.
        </li>

      <br>
    In the past, the method has been successfully applied to phage display data to identify multiple specificity patterns [Gfeller et al, MSB 2011; Kim et al. NAR 2012] and HLA-I peptidomics data to deconvolute mixtures of HLA-I ligands coming from up to 6 alleles [Bassani-Sternberg and Gfeller, JI 2016; Bassani-Sternberg et al. PLoS Comp Bio 2017; Guillaume et al PNAS 2018].
